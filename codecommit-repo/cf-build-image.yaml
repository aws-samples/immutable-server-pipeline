  # This Component in the EC2 Image Builder setup contains the main logi
  # for installing the AMI. In this demo, the full script is inline. This
  # could be modified to read a script from an S3 bucket the same way that
  # the main build artifact is taken from an S3 bucket. Since this Cloud-
  # Formation template itself is also in Version Control, it can easily
  # be updated when needed for demo purposes.
